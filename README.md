# Coursework
## COP 3337 - Computer Programming II - Java 
An intermediate level course in Object Oriented programming. Topics include primitive types, control structures, strings arrays, objects and classes, data abstraction inheritance polymorphism and an introduction to data structures.
- **_Project 1_** - Creates a "library" of books (with details such as title, author, genre, edition, pages read, and rating). Has a user menu, allowing the listing, addition, and editing of books to the "library." Practices creating and manipulating objects.
- **_Project 2_** - The Catapult object takes a series of data (speeds and angles) and determines if they can hit a target distance (between min and max). Practices manipulating data in object ArrayLists.
- **_Project 3_** - Creates and manipulates Major objects (such as English, Math, Business) accepting and updating their details (such as major, name, and ACT score). Practices inheritance between classes and subclasses, and manipulating and returning data tables.
- **_Project 4_** - Manages a list of Dinosaur objects. Has an interactive manu to display and compare different Dinosaurs. Practices inheritance between multiple abstract classes and concrete classes.
- **_Project 5_** - Reads data from a .csv file and creates TVShow objects with that data (name, year, seasons, etc). Displays an interactive user menu to sort and display certain shows. Practices insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, sequential search, and binary search.
- **_Project 6_** - Creates a "parking lot" to keep track of cars parking, having appropriate parking tags, and waiting to park. Practices queues, stacks, and linked lists.

## COP 4010 - Software Engineering I
Software Process Model, software analysis and specification, software design, testing.
- **_Local Library_** - Group project to create a Local Library website to track books being borrowed. Practices the process of Scrum - Product Owner and Development Team.
